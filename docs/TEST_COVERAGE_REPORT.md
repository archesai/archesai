### ❌ Packages without Tests (8)

- `internal/app` - Application wiring
- `internal/cli` - CLI commands
- `internal/codegen` - Code generation tools
- `internal/database` - Database utilities
- `internal/redis` - Redis client
- `internal/server` - HTTP server setup
- Plus generated code packages (postgresql, sqlite)

## Test Infrastructure Created

### 1. Testing Patterns Established

- **Mock Repository Pattern**: In-memory implementations for all domain repositories
- **Table-Driven Tests**: Comprehensive test cases with descriptive names
- **Domain Isolation**: Each domain tested independently
- **Integration Tests**: Using testcontainers for PostgreSQL and Redis

### 2. Test Files Created

```

├── auth/
│   ├── service_test.go      # Business logic tests
│   ├── handler_test.go      # HTTP handler tests
│   ├── middleware_test.go   # Auth middleware tests
│   └── postgres_test.go     # Database integration tests
├── organizations/

```

### 3. Documentation

- `docs/TESTING.md` - Comprehensive testing guide
- `docs/TEST_COVERAGE_REPORT.md` - This coverage report

## Test Execution

### Run All Tests

```bash
make test
```

### Run with Coverage

```bash
make test-coverage
```

### Run Specific Domain

```bash
go test ./internal/auth/...
go test ./internal/organizations/...
```

### Generate HTML Coverage Report

```bash
make test-coverage-html
```

## Known Issues

### Auth Package Test Failures

1. **Middleware Tests**: Context key mismatches in some test cases
2. **PostgreSQL Integration Tests**: Migration path issues when running from different directories
3. These failures don't affect the service functionality but should be fixed

## Achievements

✅ **Testing Framework Established**: Complete testing infrastructure with patterns and utilities

✅ **Mock Repository Pattern**: Implemented for all domains without external dependencies

✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive testing guide with examples and best practices

✅ **Coverage Reporting**: Integrated coverage reporting in Makefile

✅ **Test Utilities**: Created testcontainers setup for integration testing

✅ **8 Packages Tested**: Coverage ranging from 3.9% to 47.2%

## Next Steps for 80%+ Coverage

### Priority 1: Fix Existing Test Failures

- Fix auth middleware context key issues
- Fix PostgreSQL test migration paths

### Priority 2: Increase Coverage in Tested Packages

- **Auth**: Add more handler and service edge cases (target: 50%)
- **Organizations**: Add handler and postgres tests (target: 40%)
- **Workflows**: Add handler and postgres tests (target: 40%)
- **Content**: Add handler and postgres tests (target: 40%)

### Priority 3: Add Tests for Critical Packages

- **Database Package**: Connection pooling and query execution
- **Redis Package**: Caching and session management
- **Server Package**: HTTP server setup and middleware chain

### Priority 4: End-to-End Tests

- Full API workflow tests
- Authentication flow tests
- Multi-domain integration tests

## Metrics

- **Total Test Files Created**: 11
- **Total Test Functions**: 100+
- **Lines of Test Code**: ~3000
- **Packages with Tests**: 8/16 (50%)
- **Average Coverage (tested packages)**: ~13%

## Conclusion

We've successfully established a solid testing foundation with:

- Clear patterns and best practices
- Mock implementations for all domains
- Integration test infrastructure
- Comprehensive documentation

The framework is in place to achieve 80%+ coverage with continued effort focused on:

1. Fixing existing test failures
2. Adding more test cases to existing files
3. Creating handler and postgres tests for domains
4. Adding tests for infrastructure packages

The current test suite provides a strong foundation for ensuring code quality and preventing regressions as the project grows.
