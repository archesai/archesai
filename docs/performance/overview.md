# Performance Documentation

This section covers performance optimization, monitoring, and scaling strategies for Arches.

## Performance Overview

Arches is designed for high performance with several optimization strategies:

- **Stateless API servers** - Horizontal scaling capability
- **Database read replicas** - Distributed read load
- **Redis clustering** - Distributed caching
- **Queue-based processing** - Async job processing

## [Optimization Guide](optimization.md)

### Database Performance

- Connection pooling configuration
- Query optimization
- Index strategies
- Vector search optimization (pgvector)

### Application Performance

- Go performance best practices
- Memory management
- Concurrent processing patterns
- HTTP client optimization

### Caching Strategies

- Redis cache patterns
- Application-level caching
- CDN integration

## Monitoring & Observability

### Metrics Collection

- Application metrics (Prometheus)
- Infrastructure metrics (Grafana)
- Business metrics tracking

### Performance Testing

- Load testing strategies
- Benchmark procedures
- Performance regression detection

_Detailed performance guides and optimization documentation are coming in upcoming iterations._
