Here's the new information that should be added to the subtask:\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED**: Built complete email service package at `internal/email/service.go` with SMTP support for Gmail and SendGrid providers. Service includes TLS encryption, configurable SMTP settings, and HTML email templates for verification, welcome, and password reset emails. Enhanced Register method in `internal/auth/service.go` with secure random token generation using crypto/rand (32-byte hex-encoded tokens). Integrated token storage with existing PostgreSQL database using SQLC queries in `internal/database/queries/verification-tokens.sql`. Implemented both RequestEmailVerification and ConfirmEmailVerification handlers in `internal/auth/handler.go` with proper error handling for invalid/expired tokens. Email verification workflow stores tokens with 24-hour expiration in verification_token table and automatically sends welcome emails after successful verification. System supports token cleanup and re-verification requests. **REMAINING**: Need to implement password validation requirements and rate limiting middleware for registration endpoint.\n</info added on 2025-09-09T10:53:45.321Z>\n<info added on 2025-09-09T11:00:11.579Z>\n**COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION**: Successfully added comprehensive password validation function with detailed security requirements (8-128 character length, mandatory uppercase letter, lowercase letter, number, and special character from defined set !@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;:,.<>?). Password validation integrated into Register method at service.go:150 with proper error handling that returns descriptive validation failure messages. Rate limiting middleware implemented in middleware.go:254-281 using IP-based tracking with configurable maximum attempts (currently set to 10 requests per minute). Applied rate limiting to all auth endpoints in routes.go:25 by wrapping auth group with RateLimitMiddleware(10, 60). Comprehensive test suite written covering all password validation scenarios including edge cases, multiple missing requirements, and boundary conditions. All tests pass validating the robustness of the password validation logic. The registration system now enforces strong password requirements and prevents brute force attacks through IP-based rate limiting, completing all security measures for the user registration flow.\n</info added on 2025-09-09T11:00:11.579Z>",
