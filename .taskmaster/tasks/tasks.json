Here's the new information that should be added to the subtask:\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED**: Built complete email service package at `internal/email/service.go` with SMTP support for Gmail and SendGrid providers. Service includes TLS encryption, configurable SMTP settings, and HTML email templates for verification, welcome, and password reset emails. Enhanced Register method in `internal/auth/service.go` with secure random token generation using crypto/rand (32-byte hex-encoded tokens). Integrated token storage with existing PostgreSQL database using SQLC queries in `internal/database/queries/verification-tokens.sql`. Implemented both RequestEmailVerification and ConfirmEmailVerification handlers in `internal/auth/handler.go` with proper error handling for invalid/expired tokens. Email verification workflow stores tokens with 24-hour expiration in verification_token table and automatically sends welcome emails after successful verification. System supports token cleanup and re-verification requests. **REMAINING**: Need to implement password validation requirements and rate limiting middleware for registration endpoint.\n</info added on 2025-09-09T10:53:45.321Z>\n<info added on 2025-09-09T11:00:11.579Z>\n**COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION**: Successfully added comprehensive password validation function with detailed security requirements (8-128 character length, mandatory uppercase letter, lowercase letter, number, and special character from defined set !@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;:,.<>?). Password validation integrated into Register method at service.go:150 with proper error handling that returns descriptive validation failure messages. Rate limiting middleware implemented in middleware.go:254-281 using IP-based tracking with configurable maximum attempts (currently set to 10 requests per minute). Applied rate limiting to all auth endpoints in routes.go:25 by wrapping auth group with RateLimitMiddleware(10, 60). Comprehensive test suite written covering all password validation scenarios including edge cases, multiple missing requirements, and boundary conditions. All tests pass validating the robustness of the password validation logic. The registration system now enforces strong password requirements and prevents brute force attacks through IP-based rate limiting, completing all security measures for the user registration flow.\n</info added on 2025-09-09T11:00:11.579Z>",

Implementation includes service layer methods `RequestPasswordReset` (lines 869-917) and `ConfirmPasswordReset` (lines 920-1003) in `internal/auth/service.go`, plus corresponding HTTP handlers `RequestPasswordReset` (lines 355-383) and `ConfirmPasswordReset` (lines 386-449) in `internal/auth/handler.go`. OpenAPI specification defines endpoints `/auth/password-reset/request` and `/auth/password-reset/verify` with proper request/response schemas. Password reset tokens are stored in existing `verification_token` database table using \"password_reset:\" prefix for identification. Security features include 1-hour token expiry, email enumeration protection (always returns success), password strength validation, and automatic session invalidation after successful reset. Email integration uses existing `SendPasswordResetEmail` function. Build verification successful with `make generate && make build-server` completing without errors. Rate limiting automatically applied through existing auth middleware (10 requests/minute). Ready for integration testing and frontend implementation.\n</info added on 2025-09-09T13:41:03.181Z>",

Here is the new text content to append to the subtask details:\n\nCompleted comprehensive OAuth provider testing implementation covering Google, GitHub, and Microsoft providers. Tests include provider ID validation, auth URL generation with proper query parameters and HTTPS enforcement, token exchange error handling for invalid codes, refresh token support validation (including GitHub's lack of support), and comprehensive OAuth state management with TTL-based expiration. Added MockOAuthProvider for service integration testing and URL validation helpers. Fixed compatibility issues in existing test files and improved test structure. Current auth package coverage increased to 34% from initial 31.8%, demonstrating measurable progress toward the 80% target. The OAuth provider test suite now provides robust validation of all OAuth flows and error conditions, establishing a solid foundation for authentication testing.

        "details": "Comprehensive fix for multiple linting and compilation errors throughout the codebase:\n\n**1. Fix x-codegen Domain Field Requirements**:\n- Update internal/codegen/parser.go to require domain field in x-codegen extensions\n- Remove schema processing when domain is missing (lines 101-111 already correct)\n- Add validation warnings for missing domain fields\n\n**2. Remove Domain Inference Logic**:\n- Delete the deprecated inferDomain function in internal/codegen/parser.go (lines 149-169)\n- Remove any remaining calls to domain inference throughout codegen\n- Ensure all schemas explicitly specify domain in x-codegen\n\n**3. Create Hardcoded CodegenConfig**:\n- Fix internal/codegen/config.go compilation errors by updating struct field names\n- Replace undefined types (CodegenConfigGenerators, CodegenConfigOptions, etc.) with proper CodegenConfig field references\n- Create a working GetDefaultConfig() function that returns a properly structured CodegenConfig\n\n**4. Fix Config Struct Field Type Resolution**:\n- Replace interface{} types in internal/config/types.gen.go with proper concrete types\n- Update Config struct fields (API, Database, Redis, Auth, etc.) to use specific type structs instead of interface{}\n- Ensure type-safe configuration handling throughout the system\n\n**5. Fix Test Compilation Errors**:\n- Resolve undefined type errors (HealthResponse, UUID, Email types)\n- Fix type conversion issues in repository implementations (string vs *string, int64 vs int64)\n- Remove unused imports (github.com/google/uuid)\n- Fix handler parameter mismatches and undefined variables\n- Ensure all generated code compiles correctly\n\n**6. Update Type Mappings**:\n- Fix PostgreSQL repository type conversions between Go types and database types\n- Ensure proper nullable field handling (*string vs string)\n- Fix enum type handling (OrganizationPlan, RunStatus, etc.)\n- Resolve metadata field type issues (map[string]interface{} vs *string)\n\n**7. Fix Hardcoded Values in Codegen Templates**:\n- Remove hardcoded TODO comments in generated handler.gen.go files\n- Fix query parameter parsing in templates (ListRunsParamsFilter, ListRunsParamsPage, ListRunsParamsSort)\n- Implement proper request body to entity mapping instead of empty TODO sections\n- Fix template generation to produce working code without manual intervention\n\n**8. Fix Handler Generation Issues**:\n- Fix path parameter extraction in strict handler methods (internal/runs/handler.gen.go:217-247)\n- Ensure strict handler methods properly extract and pass path parameters (id) to service methods\n- Fix StrictServerInterface method signatures to include required parameters\n- Update internal/templates/tmpl/handler.tmpl and internal/codegen/generator_echo.go to generate proper parameter handling\n- Resolve missing parameter passing in DeleteRun, GetRun, and UpdateRun strict handlers\n- Ensure all handler methods properly validate and extract path/query parameters\n\n**Technical Implementation**:\n- Review and fix all generated .gen.go files for type consistency\n- Update codegen templates to generate correct type mappings and parameter handling\n- Ensure OpenAPI schema definitions match generated Go types\n- Fix internal/templates/tmpl/ templates to remove hardcoded placeholders\n- Update internal/codegen/generator_*.go files to properly parse and inject parameters\n- Run make generate && make lint to verify fixes",
