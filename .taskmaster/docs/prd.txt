# Overview  
ArchesAI is an AI-native workflow automation platform that democratizes complex data processing and AI operations for non-technical users. Unlike traditional automation tools that bolt on AI features, ArchesAI is built from the ground up with AI at its core, enabling users to create, modify, and optimize workflows through natural language while maintaining the power and flexibility that enterprises demand.

The platform solves the critical gap between powerful AI capabilities and business users who lack engineering expertise. While tools like n8n require technical knowledge to configure integrations and write expressions, ArchesAI uses conversational AI to translate business requirements into executable workflows, making advanced automation accessible to product managers, analysts, and business operators.
