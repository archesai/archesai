# Overview
ArchesAI is an AI-powered code generation platform that transforms OpenAPI specifications into production-ready full-stack applications. Unlike traditional code generators that produce boilerplate templates, ArchesAI leverages containerized AI environments where Claude can develop, test, and refine code in real-time, creating sophisticated applications following hexagonal architecture patterns and modern best practices.

The platform solves the fundamental challenge of bridging the gap between API design and implementation. While developers can easily define what their application should do through OpenAPI specs, translating these specifications into well-architected, maintainable code requires significant expertise and time. ArchesAI automates this process while maintaining the flexibility for developers to interact with AI to customize and refine the generated code through natural language.
