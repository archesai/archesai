## Project Structure

ArchesAI uses a hexagonal (ports and adapters) architecture with Domain-Driven Design principles:

```
archesai/
├── api/                  # OpenAPI specifications
├── cmd/                  # Application entry points
├── internal/
│   ├── app/             # Application assembly & dependency injection
│   ├── domains/         # Business domains (hexagonal architecture)
│   │   ├── auth/        # Authentication & authorization
│   │   ├── organizations/ # Organization management
│   │   ├── workflows/   # Pipeline workflows & tools
│   │   └── content/     # Content artifacts & labels
│   ├── infrastructure/  # Shared technical infrastructure
│   └── generated/       # Generated code (OpenAPI, SQLC)
├── web/                 # Frontend monorepo (pnpm workspaces)
│   ├── platform/        # Main React application
│   ├── client/          # Generated TypeScript API client
│   └── ui/              # Shared component library
└── docs/                # Documentation
```

Each domain follows hexagonal architecture with:

- `core/` - Business logic, entities, and ports
- `infrastructure/` - Database implementations
- `handlers/` - HTTP handlers
- `adapters/` - Type converters
- `generated/` - Domain-specific generated code

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Go with Echo framework, hexagonal architecture
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with pgvector for embeddings
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, TanStack Router, Vite
- **Code Generation**: SQLC, OpenAPI generators, custom adapters
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes with Helm charts
